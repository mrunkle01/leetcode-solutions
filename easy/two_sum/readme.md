## 🧠 Problem Summary

I was given a container of ints, in this case it was a vector, and a target.
The Goal was to find two numbers from the vector that combine to equal the value of the target. 
If found return the indices in a vector.

## 🔍 Constraints

- Assume there is only one solution
- May not use same index twice

## 💡 Approach

- Initially thought of using a brute force method by combaring each value to each of the rest in the vector. Then I decided to go with a hashmap that
- Mention what algorithms/data structures you considered.
- If you optimized, explain how and why.
